Lars Francke's dotfiles, managed with https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi[`chezmoi`].

Install them with:

    chezmoi init https://github.com/lfrancke/dotfiles.git

Secrets are stored in https://bitwarden.com[BitWarden] and you'll need the https://github.com/bitwarden/cli[BitWarden CLI] installed.
Login to BitWarden with:

----
bw login <email>
bw unlock

export BW_SESSION= ... <as printed by bw unlock>
----

This is meant to work in tandem with my https://github.com/lfrancke/arch-setup/[arch-setup] repository which deals with all the system level stuff while these dotfiles are all user local.

== Post-Installation Steps


== Maintenance

=== Updating Neovim Plugins

To keep your Neovim plugins up to date, run:

----
:Lazy sync
----

This will install missing plugins, update existing ones, and clean up removed plugins.

Other useful commands:

* `:Lazy` - Open the lazy.nvim UI to see plugin status
* `:Lazy update` - Update all plugins
* `:Lazy clean` - Remove plugins no longer in config
* `:Lazy health` - Check for issues
